# april 2016:
# with volumename it shows a few dupe entries, not because the sql query is wrong, but because there are actually jobs
# with two volumes, though i explicitly set `Maximum Volume Jobs = 1`. i checked the volumes and both volumes exist,
# but one of the volumes has very few bytes and no data is inside. so this must be some sort of bug which results into
# orphan media entries and orphan volume files. check this later out and ignore it for now
