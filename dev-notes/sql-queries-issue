# Note from April 2016:
# With volumename a few dupe entries appeared, not because the sql query is wrong, but because there are actually jobs
# with two volumes, though i explicitly set `Maximum Volume Jobs = 1`. I checked the volumes and both volumes exist,
# but one of the volumes has very few bytes and no data is inside. So this must be some sort of bug which results into
# orphan media entries and orphan volume files. Check this later out and ignore it for now.
